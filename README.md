# Welcome to the Mapbox Video Production Department
This is the home of the Mapbox video production team. 
Here you'll find how to request video or photography work, find video files, as well as tools to help us help you faster and more efficiently.

## How we work
We are typically producing a number of videos at one time based on priority and need.
- If you have an urgent need, please complete a ticket and follow-up with a slack message #videoteam. 
- If you have an idea or plan that is not urgent, please provide as much information as possible and we will be in touch soon.
- If you need a pull request, please create a new ticket and followup with a slack message at #videoteam.
